                        <p>Aloha! My name is Keilana, and I'm delighted to introduce myself as the owner and founder of Leis by Lana. It all started back in 2018 when I found myself mesmerized by the exquisite lei poʻo adorned by my fellow dance mates after our performances. However, as much as I longed for one of my own, I simply couldn't afford it. Determined to turn my passion into reality, I embarked on a journey of discovery and self-teaching. Since the tender age of 16, I've been pushing the boundaries of traditional lei poʻo crafting, experimenting with elements like sunflowers, faux butterflies, and anything else that ignites my curiosity.</p>
                        <p>My fascination with floral artistry doesn't end with lei poʻo. I've developed a profound appreciation for various forms of floral arrangements, from towering five-foot garlands to delicate boutonnieres and corsages. At Leis by Lana, we thrive on bringing our customers' imaginations to life, no matter how unique or elaborate their vision may be.</p>
                        <p>Central to our ethos is the celebration of native Hawaiian flora. Through our work, we aim not only to showcase the beauty of these indigenous plants but also to raise awareness about their significance in Hawaiian culture and the urgent need to preserve them from extinction. Every creation we make is infused with a deep respect for the natural world and a commitment to environmental stewardship.</p>    
                        <p>But perhaps my greatest joy lies in the reactions of our customers. There's nothing quite like witnessing the sheer delight on someone's face when they first lay eyes on our creations or proudly wear them. It's these moments of pure happiness that fuel my passion and drive me to continually innovate and inspire through my work.</p>  
                        <p>Thank you for considering Leis by Lana to be a part of your special moments. We look forward to crafting something extraordinary together. Mahalo!</p>
